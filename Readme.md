# Rotating 3D Cube using Three.js

This project is a hands-on exploration of **Three.js fundamentals**. The goal was not to build a complex application, but to understand how 3D rendering works on the web from the ground up.

## What I learned

- Setting up a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer  
- Creating and positioning 3D geometries  
- Applying materials and colors to objects  
- Animating objects using the render loop  
- Understanding the basic 3D coordinate system and transformations  

## About the project

This rotating cube represents my first step into **web-based 3D graphics**. It serves as a foundation for more advanced concepts such as lighting, textures, 3D models, and interactive scenes.

Small projects like this help strengthen my core understanding, and this repository documents that learning process.

## Tech Stack

- Three.js  
- JavaScript  
- HTML / CSS
